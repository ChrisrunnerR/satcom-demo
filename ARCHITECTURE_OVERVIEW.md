# 🏗️ Architecture Overview - What We Built

## 🤔 **What's the Difference?**

You now have **TWO DIFFERENT APPS** in this project:

---

## 1️⃣ **Streamlit App** (Original - UI App)

**File:** `streamlit_app.py`  
**Type:** Web UI with buttons and sliders  
**Purpose:** Interactive demo for humans to click around

**What it does:**

- Pretty web interface
- Generate text button
- Convert to speech button
- Sliders for noise/packet loss
- Shows graphs and metrics
- **Good for:** Demos, presentations, manual testing

**How to run locally:**

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Opens in browser at: http://localhost:8501

**Deployment:** Streamlit Cloud (FREE) - see `START_HERE.md`

---

## 2️⃣ **FastAPI Backend** (NEW - REST API)

**File:** `main.py`  
**Type:** REST API server (no UI, just endpoints)  
**Purpose:** Programmatic access for other apps/systems

**What it does:**

- Provides API endpoints (URLs that return data)
- No buttons or UI - just sends/receives JSON
- Can be called from ANY programming language
- Can integrate with other systems
- **Good for:** Production apps, mobile apps, integrations

**How to run locally:**

```bash
python main.py
```

API available at: http://localhost:8000  
Interactive docs at: http://localhost:8000/docs

**Deployment:** DigitalOcean Droplet ($6/month) - see `DIGITALOCEAN_QUICKSTART.md`

## 📊 **Side-by-Side Comparison**

| Feature                | Streamlit App          | FastAPI Backend         |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **File**               | `streamlit_app.py`     | `main.py`               |
| **Type**               | Web UI                 | REST API                |

| **Has buttons?**       | ✅ Yes                 | ❌ No                   |
| **Has API endpoints?** | ❌ No                  | ✅ Yes                  |
| **Deploy to**          | Streamlit Cloud (FREE) | DigitalOcean ($6/mo)    |
| **Use case**           | Demo, presentation     | Production, integration |
| **Local URL**          | http://localhost:8501  | http://localhost:8000   |

## 🔑 **Key Concept: "Local Demo" vs "Deployed"**

### **"Local Demo"** = Running on YOUR computer

- Only YOU can access it
- Free
- Stops when you close terminal
- Both apps can run locally!

```bash
# Run Streamlit locally:
streamlit run streamlit_app.py

# OR run FastAPI locally:
python main.py
```

### **"Deployed"** = Running on a server in the cloud

- ANYONE can access it via URL
- Costs money (or free tier)
- Runs 24/7 even when your computer is off
- Need to deploy each app separately

```
Streamlit → Deploy to Streamlit Cloud (FREE)
FastAPI → Deploy to DigitalOcean ($6/mo with $200 credit)
```

## 🎯 **What We Built Today**

### ✅ **We Created:**

1. **FastAPI Backend** (`main.py`)

   - REST API with all satcom features
   - 8 API endpoints
   - Docker setup
   - GitHub Actions auto-deploy
   - **Status:** ✅ Running locally at http://localhost:8000

2. **Deployment Configuration**

   - `Dockerfile` - Containerize the app
   - `docker-compose.yml` - Easy deployment
   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Auto-deploy on git push
   - **Status:** ✅ Ready to deploy

3. **Documentation**
   - `DIGITALOCEAN_QUICKSTART.md` - Deploy FastAPI
   - `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Detailed guide
   - **Status:** ✅ Complete

### 🔄 **We Did NOT Change:**

- Original Streamlit app (`streamlit_app.py`) still works!
- Can still deploy to Streamlit Cloud
- See `START_HERE.md` for Streamlit deployment

## 📡 **Your FastAPI Endpoints Explained**

When you run `python main.py`, you get these API endpoints:

### **Basic Endpoints:**

```
GET  /              → API info and status
GET  /health        → Health check
```

### **Feature Endpoints:**

```
POST /api/generate-text          → OpenAI text generation
POST /api/generate-speech        → Google TTS (text→audio)
POST /api/simulate-transmission  → Add satcom effects
POST /api/evaluate-audio         → Check audio quality
POST /api/full-pipeline          → Complete end-to-end
```

### **How to Use:**

**Example 1: Generate Text**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/generate-text \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"minutes": 0, "seconds": 10}'
```

**Example 2: Interactive Docs**
Just open in browser: http://localhost:8000/docs  
→ You get a UI to test all endpoints!

## 🤷 **Which One Should You Use?**

### **Use Streamlit App when:**

- Demoing to non-technical people
- Quick manual testing
- Presentations
- You want a pretty UI

### **Use FastAPI Backend when:**

- Building a mobile app
- Integrating with other systems
- Need API access
- Production deployment
- Your EL wants "proper backend architecture"

---

## 🚀 **Deployment Paths**

### **Path 1: Deploy Streamlit (Easiest)**

```
Follow: START_HERE.md
Time: 15 minutes
Cost: FREE
Result: https://your-app.streamlit.app
```

### **Path 2: Deploy FastAPI (What your EL wants)**

```
Follow: DIGITALOCEAN_QUICKSTART.md
Time: 15 minutes
Cost: $6/month ($200 free credit = 33 months free!)
Result: http://YOUR_DROPLET_IP:8000
```

### **Path 3: Deploy Both! (Recommended)**

```
1. Deploy Streamlit to Streamlit Cloud (FREE UI)
2. Deploy FastAPI to DigitalOcean ($6/mo API)
3. Make Streamlit call your FastAPI
Result: Best of both worlds!
```

## 📝 **What Your EL Asked For**

Your EL said:

> "Spin up a FastAPI server on DigitalOcean with GitHub Actions auto-deploy"

**What we built:** ✅

- ✅ FastAPI server (`main.py`)
- ✅ Docker configuration
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow
- ✅ DigitalOcean deployment guide
- ⏸️ Just need to finish adding payment method to DigitalOcean

---

## 🎬 **Current Status**

### **What's Running Right Now:**

```
✅ FastAPI Server: http://localhost:8000
   - Running on your Mac
   - Only you can access
   - Test at: http://localhost:8000/docs

🔄 Streamlit App: NOT running
   - Can start with: streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   - Would run at: http://localhost:8501

⏸️ DigitalOcean: 90% setup
   - Need to add payment card
   - Then click "Create Droplet"
   - Will get: http://DROPLET_IP:8000
```

## 🎯 **TL;DR - Simple Explanation**

**Original Project:**

- Had a Streamlit app with a UI

**What We Added Today:**

- Built a FastAPI backend (REST API version)
- No UI, just API endpoints
- Can call it from code
- Set up Docker + auto-deploy
- 90% configured DigitalOcean

**Both apps do the same thing, just different interfaces:**

- Streamlit = For humans (buttons, UI)
- FastAPI = For programs (JSON, API)

**Both can run "locally" (on your Mac) or "deployed" (on a server)**
